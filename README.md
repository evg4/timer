## Project Title
Timer
## Description
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I created it on 21.08.23 to practise using the useState() hook together with the useEffect() hook. There are two effects: the number updates in line with the setTimer, and the background changes to a random colour at the same time. However, there is an undesired effect in that the button can be clicked multiple times and the timer speeds up. I tried adding a removeEventListener but was unable to get this working. So I am aware that this particular project has its drawbacks, however it was still a useful exercise to practise other concepts, and I hope to improve my skills in this area later either by updating this app, or making a new one with a similar feature that works as intended.
