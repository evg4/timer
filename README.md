## Project Title
Timer
## Description
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I created it on 21.08.23 to practise using the useState() hook together with the useEffect() hook. There are two effects: the number updates in line with the setTimer, and the background changes to a random colour at the same time. Originally, there was an undesired effect in that the button can be clicked multiple times and the timer speeds up. This was due to me not quite understanding how to use clearInterval() and setInterval() together.
I came back to this on 03.07.25, reread my notes on useEffect (after almost 2 years since last using it!) and was able to correct my code to achieve the desired effect. I also took the opportunity to refactor it to improve readability and remove some unneccessary parts.
